## Answers
1. Which of the users below had insecure passwords?
2. What is the password?
3. What mistake did the users make? If you cracked the password using a word-list, the type of word-list gives a good indication for that. Is it a commonly used password? Is it re-used from somewhere? Is it phished?
4. What would you advise them?
5. (Bonus) Which two users really don't like each other?
